My first base layer barely showed up. After a few trials, I realized I had to forgo my usual method of layering thin washes on top of each other and letting each layer meet the next to form a unique conversation between old and new."

Regret, shame, and guilt start to crawl out from the corners of my mind, probing at  my eyelids.My first sketch was more brutal. I imagined those thoughts physically prying my eyelids open, leeching onto the body. Those thoughts violently yank one from peace. But that didn’t capture the strange, mocking quality of self-torment I wanted to express."

For a moment, I wanted to halt and simply exist in its hums.But my mind raced ahead. Buried under thoughts, I continued home, not daring to turn my back on the refreshing lull. It was in that tension between the stillness I craved and the restlessness pushing forward that this painting was born.The figure leans toward the sky, reaching for more despite being in an already full tub of abundance. It is  caught between the desire to strive for more and the pull of serene stillness. It is that in-between, the fragile space where satisfaction and ambition collide, that I wanted to capture."

            "description": "The sketch came to be one time I tried alcohol. It was half a bottle of vodka at a sleepover. I finally understood that burning feeling people crave. It lightens your head. It thins your reasoning. And I started to go with whatever feels good. We were watching 2 Broke Girls. The first season kicked off with tasteful remarks. Yet near the end, when we were already tipsy, the jokes leaned more towards lazy stereotypes - all kinds of things that should never be funny. Yet we laughed. Maybe it was the vodka. Maybe it was the atmosphere. In that moment, laughter was easier than thinking. Fun triumphed over reason.In hindsight, I felt a sting of guilt. I blurred the line. I chose to indulge."

He forgets himself. His kindness, like ours that night, gets swallowed by the flame of indulgence.When morning came, he fell silent because of the remarks he made. Both of us, in our own ways, were scorched by moments where pleasure drowned thought.Alcohol feels like fire to me now. It warms first, then consumes. What it leaves behind is the guilt, the regret lingers long after the night ends."

            "description": "The work depicts a bleeding heart flower whose toxins are capable of burning the skin. The figure crawls into it, drawn by the sweet nectar, seemingly unconcerned that it will blister their skin. The pose was inspired by a mat Pilates move I tried when I joined a temporary Pilates class to fix my spine - a result from a year of intense cramping for high school admission exams. My back, a little mischievous in its own way, remembered the effort. I return to that pose often to ease the tension after long days, and to remind myself that I don’t have to endure intense strain just to reach the nectar of a flower.The red of the flower carries more than the warning of burning; it’s the color of passion, desire, temptation. While the figure chases the sweetness, the flower latches onto its back, drawing livelihood. It’s a reflection of society itself: it offers people little delights in exchange for exploits the drive and productivity it inspires. The piece is both playful and cautionary, a reminder of the cost of chasing what seems sweet while ignoring the burns along the way."

Its title, Arrogance, felt almost inevitable.Before me sat a girl who seemed to excel effortlessly at everything I had ever wished to master: math, physics, literature. Her kindness to everyone, her ease in every task felt all so suffocating as I constantly measured my own shortcomings. I spent months observing her, scolding myself silently when she raised her hand for extra credit, and I had not. Tired of reckoning my every step, I stepped back to reflect and noticed how much I had neglected my own strengths in a futile attempt to mirror her abilities in areas that never truly interested me."

Arms reaching for ballet poses, legs striding to the rhythms of samba, straining toward a foreign tune. Its face, arrogant and unyielding, bears no color of its own as it had forwent its individuality.I took inspiration from Francis Bacon’s Figure Study II. I wanted to experiment with his gaping, contorted mouth set against a single, stark background, and I nearly succumbed to using the dark, oppressive hues he favored in shading, to heighten the grotesqueness.But then, as always, I gravitated toward vibrant colors. Turquoise and pink carve the contours of the body, the limbs, the stretch and strain of envy made flesh. Even in grotesque tension, there is a tinge of color - there is hope for change."

            "description": "This piece demanded more effort in the idea stage than usual. I wanted to explore a Brachiosaurus shaped human, stretching neck and limbs. I wanted the character to feel enormous, looming, yet utterly awkward, clinging to a tiny toilet - a visual metaphor for weak resolve facing an inadequate solution. Its body is oversized, yet the toilet is ridiculously small, highlighting this tension between drive and cowardice.I sketched  a self-portrait to  figure out which features I could exaggerate to tell the story I wanted. In a way, it was a reminder of who the characters in my work are supposed to resemble: my experience reflected wider into human responses.The idea came from my own “bathroom breaks” during intense cram sessions. I would sit on the toilet lid, watching time pass just to escape the stress that awaited me once I resumed studying. But the anxiety never left. I was still counting the seconds until the next test, and I tried to externalize that feeling through the yellow head screaming like an alarm - a constant internal reminder of impending deadlines."

But sometimes I wish the day would not come, would not arrive with its happy birdsongs and expectant smiles, insisting I brim with energy for a “fresh start.” I quickly retreat to the bathroom, hiding from the bubbly chirps and, more painfully, from myself. I try to lie down on the cold floor, to sleep. Yet the energy of a new day pulses stubbornly within me.It is not that I lack energy; rather, I lack the mindset for this new day. So I sit, still and aimless, waiting for the tank to drain just enough so that I no longer feel overwhelmed or guilty for failing to meet the invisible quota of potential."

Yet a quiet, insistent voice lingered in my mind, whispering that I should be pursuing academics instead. To the voice, studying would yield better rewards. After all, people would value me more if I said I studied Physics than were I to say I simply drew. That week, I had set aside four hours to paint. One and a half of them had slipped away into thoughts of what I “should” do with that time."

In the modern war in Vietnam, it was Vietnamese people fighting Vietnamese people, each side pulled by distant voices, from powers that never set foot in the mud of the land they divided. The tragedy deepened when I realized that even those Western commanders, so seemingly in control, were themselves only extensions of a larger machine. Layers upon layers of puppetry, each string pulled by another unseen hand.I thought of the roosters. Sacred in Vietnamese culture, humble symbols of spirit. In my painting, both roosters look the same, like brothers, yet they fight each other fiercely while unseen forces look down from above, entertained by their struggle.I used the imagery from Journey to the West - my favorite long odyssey of divines and wanderers. Its mythic sense of high forces felt like the right language to tell this story. "

Around me, my desk was scattered with odds and ends - things I had held onto for no reason other than a faint faith that one day they might be useful. When I began this mixed-media sculpture, I realized that all this time, I had been searching for a way to breathe life back into the things my family usually discards.I used spare coins from my parents’ business trips, threads from a failed embroidery project I tried back in middle school, foil paper, a plastic bag—whatever I could find. Using these everyday objects makes the process feel playful and intimate, like I’m weaving the love I’ve kept for these small things into something new. Every piece becomes a little world of hope and care, recycled not just in material but in spirit. It’s like each sculpture is full of love, and I get to pour mine into it."

                "detail":"Flipping through History textbooks on the past millennium, praises of generals and emperors echoed, none of which were for women. When shut out by  Confucian patriarchy, women wove their resistance into art and medicine. Their intelligence could never be erased, just shifted. In Hanoi, I traced the names carved into the city, yet absent from our memory. A street name. A weathered tomb. Walking those roads felt like listening to a chorus of quiet brilliance. I began telling their stories through Thanh Vinh Hoa to tourists and locals whose eyes lit with the same wonder and ache I felt. That defined the project's mission: an act of admiration and remembrance, to give voice to the women whose minds shaped Vietnam with witty flexibility.",

Students bring homemade chung cakes to these unseen hands, offering warmth and gratitude. To capture this essence, I envisioned the artwork in traditional Vietnamese embroidery, a familiar presence in many homes, reflecting the steady, unassuming beauty of those who sustain our streets. I wove  Art Nouveau’s vibrant lines and colors into the PR campaign, giving their subtle, enduring contributions a modern, luminous voice.",

                    "detail":"Lately, I have been captivated by the ways traditional Vietnamese instruments are being modernized. I remember a concert where the đàn bầu emitted electric guitar–like sounds in Trống Cơm, and sáo mèo carried the driving melody in Chiếc Khăn Piêu. The performance drew young people from all our diverse ethnicities into a shared space of appreciation and joy.This experience sparked my curiosity about how ethnic music carries stories, traditions, and values across Vietnamese communities. I realized that through exchanging music, we are also exchanging culture, learning deeply about one another’s histories and identities.To explore this further, I interned at the Vietnam Museum of Ethnology, seeking to understand the power of music. There, I created thirty gouache paintings on poonah paper depicting instruments from various regions and ethnic groups, highlighting the richness and uniqueness of Vietnamese cultural identity. I also produced colorless works portraying the music and dance festivals of the Muong people, which were distributed alongside zodiac animal prints to engage children and parents alike in these traditions. Watching children spark questions and conversations, I felt a profound pride not just in my work, but in the realization that my art could foster appreciation and connection.Through this journey, I came to understand that my art has power: the power to share, to educate, and to celebrate the diverse stories that shape who we are.",
